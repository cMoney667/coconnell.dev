        My name is Collin O'Connell, I am currently the Lead Developer at <a href="https://www.gardner-white.com" target="_blank">Gardner-White Furniture</a>.
        I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript.

    <p>
        I have a background in accessibility standards within the web, and like the idea of going back to the Web 1.0 era.
    </p>
    <p>
        I write some of my ideas, and some of the issues that I run into.
